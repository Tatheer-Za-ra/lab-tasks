  <h1>A Book That Stays With Me</h1>
  <h3>Author Introduction: Tehmina Durrani </h3>

   <p> Tehmina Durrani is a Pakistani author and women's rights activist, 
        known for her courageous writings that challenge societal norms.
        Her collaboration with Abdul Sattar Edhi on his autobiography,
        "A Mirror to the Blind," offers an intimate portrayal of his life's work and philosophy.</p>

    <h3>  Why I Love This Book  </h3>

  <p>
    The opening chapter of <em>"A Mirror to the Blind" </em> deeply touched me as it described the horrific train crash in Ghotki in 2005.
     In the midst of the disaster, Abdul Sattar Edhi heard about the death of his favorite grandson Bilal.
      In spite of his personal tragedy, Edhi decided to continue his work for the rescue of the victims, reflecting his selfless devotion to humanity. This story not 
    only showcases the depth of his compassion but also as a testament to the selflessness and resilience that embody true humanitarianism.
  </p>

  <h3> My Favorite Line </h3>

  <p>
    Among the numerous moving scenes, one of the most striking is Edhi's reaction on hearing of Bilal's death:

<q><em>Do not wait for me in proceeding with Bilal's funeral rites</em> </q>his wife Bilquis Edhi remembers him saying, <q><em>A lot of my Bilals are waiting for me in Ghotki.</em></q>

This remark summarizes the way Edhi equated the death of innumerable strangers to that of his own grandson, demonstrating his deep empathy and commitment.

 <h3>A Glimpse into Edhi's Humanity</h3> 

 <p> This chapter offers a window into Edhi's remarkable character, showcasing his ability to transcend personal sorrow to serve others. His actions during the Ghotki tragedy
   illustrate a rare blend of personal sacrifice and unwavering duty, setting a powerful example of what it means to live for others.</p>
