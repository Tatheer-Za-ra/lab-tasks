git init

git status

git commit -m "commit msg" <file name>

git remote add origin <your-repo-url>



git push -u origin main
it does the following:

1️⃣ git push → Pushes the committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
2️⃣ origin → This is the name of the remote repository (default name for GitHub when you clone or link a repo).
3️⃣ main → This specifies the branch you are pushing (default branch in newer Git setups).
4️⃣ -u (or --set-upstream) → This sets origin main as the default upstream branch for future git push and git pull commands.


git branch -M main
This renames the current branch to main.

Older Git versions used master as the default branch.
-M (force move) ensures the branch is renamed even if main already exists.
